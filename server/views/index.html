            educational opportunity for
            you and a part-time internship.As such, your internship will include training/orientation and focus
            primarily
            onlearning
            and developing new skills and gaining a deeper understanding of concepts through the hands-on application of

        <p>
          You shall be governed by the following terms and conditions of service during your association with Peershala,
          and those may be amended from time to time. <br> <br>
          1. Peershala follows a three-step disciplinary process: verbal warning, written warning and termination. We
          use
          this
          approach to give interns the time and opportunity to fix their mistakes. However, Peershala reserves the right
          to skip any
          of the steps in this process and move directly to termination, if necessary. <br><br> 2. To resign from your
          position,
          we ask that
          interns submit a written two-week (at minimum) notice to their supervisor directly. <br><br>
          3. At Peershala, we are
          always
          striving to improve. Exit interviews have a proven track record of providing helpful and insightful
          information
          about an
          individual’s time with the agency. Exit interviews are not mandatory but encouraged to openly discuss areas of
          improvement. <br><br> 4. Peershala is proud to offer flexible work hours for our interns, so they can easily
          balance
          their
          internship obligations with the demands of their daily life. <br><br> 5. Peershala is free to terminate any
          intern's
          tenure without
          any prior notice if he/she tries to violate the rules, regulations of the organisation and is found not
          performing up to
          the mark. <br><br>
          6. Peershala recognizes each intern’s right to individual respect and dignity and is committed to
          establishing
          and maintaining a professional, respectful learning and working environment for all. It is the policy of the
          Peershala
          to encourage and maintain a learning environment which is free from religious,racial or sexual harassment and
          violence.
          Peershala prohibits any form of religious, racial or sexual harassment and violence. It shall be a violation
          of this
          policy for any intern to harass or inflict, or threaten to inflict, violence upon any personal issue. Peershala will
          act to
          investigate all complaints, either formal or informal, verbal or written, of religious, racial or
          sexual harassment or
          violence, and to discipline or take appropriate action against any intern, who is found to have violated this
          policy.
          Peershala prohibits retaliation against individuals who participate in the complaint process.

          7. Peershala prohibits discrimination in any form on the basis of race,creed, religion, gender, color,
          nationality,
          family, status, disability, status with regard to public assistance, sexual orientation, age, veteran status

          layoff,
          recall, corrective actions, termination, compensation and training. <br><br>

          8. A conflict or a potential conflict of interest can arise at any time.Interns must disclose such situations
          to their
          supervisors before occurrence, if possible, and in any event as quickly as possible after it arises. If interns
          are in
          doubt about a situation, they should fully disclose the situation. <br><br>

          9. Closely monitoring the performance of interns and
          the company as a whole is our priority. At Peershala, we conduct regular performance reviews. <br><br>

          10. We have a performance
          based promotion/demotion policy. That means, if you have an escalating performance, there are chances
          your position will
          be promoted. Same goes for demotion. <br>
